          <h1>Technical Implementation</h1>
          <h2>Key Technologies Used</h2>
          <p> 
            The Open-Response system is built using a modern web stack, including: 
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Frontend</strong>: Vite with React.js for a responsive and dynamic user interface, ensuring a smooth user experience. </li> 
              <li><strong>Backend</strong>: Node.js with Express.js for RESTful API, ensuring efficient data handling and communication.</li>
              <li><strong>Database</strong>: MySQL for robust data storage and management, providing scalability and reliability.</li>
              <li><strong>Real-Time Communication</strong>: WebSockets for real-time interaction between instructors and students during polling sessions.</li>
              <li><strong>Caching</strong>: Redis for caching frequently accessed data, improving performance and reducing latency.</li> 
              <li><strong>Containerization and Orchestration</strong>: Docker for containerization, ensuring consistent environments across development and production. Docker Swarm for orchestrating multi-container applications.</li>
              <li><strong>Deployment</strong>: AWS Lightsail for hosting the application, ensuring high availability and performance.</li>
          </p>
          <h2>Architecture Overview</h2>
          <p>Open Response uses a modular, containerized architecture to support scalability, reliability, and ease of maintenance. Each service runs in its own Docker container, enabling smooth deployment, load balancing, and horizontal scaling as classroom usage grows. The following diagram illustrates the system's key components and their interactions:</p>
          <figure>
            <img id="system-architecture-diagram" src="images/systemArchitectureDiagram.png" alt="Architecture Diagram" />
            <figcaption><strong>Figure 2.</strong> System architecture showing frontend, backend, and database layers under Docker Swarm orchestration.</figcaption>

          </figure>
          <p>The architecture is built for high concurrency and real-time interaction. Incoming user traffic is routed through a load balancer that distributes requests to containerized services managed by Docker Swarm. The Vite/React frontend communicates with two backend APIs: a REST API for standard HTTP requests and a WebSocket API for live classroom interactions. Backend services interact with a Redis cache for fast, transient data access and a MySQL database for persistent storage. This separation of concerns ensures scalable performance, low-latency updates, and easier maintenance as resource demands grow.</p>

          <h2>Development Challenges and Solutions</h2>
          <p>
            Some of the key challenges encountered by the latest development team largely revolve around inhereted technical debt from earlier design decisions made by previous groups. These caused significant setbacks in the development process, delaying the project timeline and requiring extensive refactoring of the codebase. These issues have largely been resolved, but at the cost of less feature completion by the 2024-2025 team.<br><br>
            Regardless, the larged obstacle faced by the team is a lack of sufficent development time. The project is being developed as part of a capstone course, and the team is limited to a single academic year to complete the project, while simultaneously balancing a normal credit workload. This has resulted in a lack of time to fully implement all features and test them thoroughly. The team has worked hard to prioritize the most important features and ensure that they are implemented correctly, but there is still remaining work to be done.
